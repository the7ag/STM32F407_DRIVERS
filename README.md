## Introduction

The STM32F407 microcontroller is a powerful device for embedded applications. To make the development process more accessible and efficient, this repository offers a collection of drivers that simplify interfacing with its peripherals. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced embedded developer, these drivers aim to streamline your development process.

## Getting Started

Before using these drivers, ensure you have set up your development environment and have a basic understanding of the STM32F407 microcontroller. If you are new to STM32 development, consult the official STM32 documentation and reference manuals for a comprehensive guide.

To start using the drivers, follow these general steps:

1. Clone this repository to your development environment.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/the7ag/STM32F407_DRIVERS.git
   ```

2. Include the relevant header files in your project.

   ```c
   #include "RCC_interface.h"
   #include "GPIO_interface.h"
   #include "NVIC_interface.h"
   #include "EXTI_interface.h"
   #include "SYSTICK_interface.h"
   #include "DMA_interfacer.h"
   #include "SPI_INTERFACE.h"
   #include "UART_INTERFACE.h"
   ```

3. Configure your microcontroller, initialize the peripheral, and start using the drivers as needed in your application.

## Peripheral Drivers

### RCC Driver

The RCC (Reset and Clock Control) driver provides functions for configuring and controlling the system and peripheral clocks of the STM32F407 microcontroller.

Learn more in the [RCC Driver Documentation](RCC_DRIVER.md).

### GPIO Driver

The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) driver enables you to set up and control GPIO pins for various purposes, including digital input and output.

Learn more in the [GPIO Driver Documentation](GPIO_DRIVER.md).

### NVIC Driver

The NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) driver assists in configuring and managing interrupts on the STM32F407 microcontroller.

Learn more in the [NVIC Driver Documentation](NVIC_DRIVER.md).

### EXTI Driver

The EXTI (External Interrupt) driver allows you to handle external interrupts and GPIO pin interrupts with ease.

Learn more in the [EXTI Driver Documentation](EXTI_DRIVER.md).

### SysTick Driver

The SysTick driver simplifies using the SysTick timer for timing and interval-based operations.

Learn more in the [SysTick Driver Documentation](SYSTICK_DRIVER.md).

### DMA Driver

The DMA (Direct Memory Access) driver provides functions to facilitate efficient data transfer between memory and peripherals.

Learn more in the [DMA Driver Documentation](DMA_DRIVER.md).

### SPI Driver

The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) driver simplifies SPI communication, whether you are using SPI in master or slave mode.

Learn more in the [SPI Driver Documentation](SPI_DRIVER.md).

### UART Driver

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) driver helps you set up and manage UART communication for serial data transfer.

Learn more in the [UART Driver Documentation](UART_DRIVER.md).
